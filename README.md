# CS61A Self-Study Journey in Python

## Overview

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to the work I accomplished during my self-study journey in object-oriented programming with Python, through the CS61A course from UC Berkeley. From August 2023 to January 2024, I delved deeply into this course, pushing my boundaries and expanding my knowledge.

## Repository Contents

Inside this repository, you will find a variety of materials that represent my dedication and progress through the course. This includes:

- **Labs:** Hands-on assignments that helped reinforce the concepts learned in each module. These labs are a testament to my practical understanding of Python programming.
- **Homeworks:** A series of challenging problems that I worked through, each testing my comprehension and application of the course material.
- **Projects:** Larger, more complex assignments where I applied the cumulative knowledge gained from the course, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world programming scenarios.

## Learning Journey

This journey wasn't just about learning Python; it was about embracing the challenge of self-directed education. I am particularly proud of the dedication and discipline I maintained throughout this period, as well as the problem-solving skills and programming techniques I developed.

## Purpose of the Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to share my learning experience with others who might be on a similar path. Whether you are a fellow learner, a curious observer, or even an employer looking to understand my coding journey, I hope this repository offers you valuable insights into my skills and dedication.
